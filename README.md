<summary>Final Note</summary>

It is not meant to be a competitor for other Legacy modpacks that exists as it is a fork of Re-Console. Nimbus Legacy goes on a different direction rather than focusing on it's features.

Due to some negative aspects during previous developments, it'll be a one-man project from now on.

If you're not interested in Nimbus Legacy and wanted an even better alternative, you can check out [Re-Console](https://modrinth.com/modpack/legacy-minecraft), [William's Console](https://modrinth.com/modpack/williams-console) or [Better Adventures++ LCE](https://modrinth.com/modpack/better-adventures++-lce).
